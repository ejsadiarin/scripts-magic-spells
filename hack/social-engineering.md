### When interviewing for a company

- Ask them THIS one question:
  - **If you were to hire me today, in what part of the company would I be the most impactful in?**
  - Reason: this frames the recruiter that you're already in the company and not just a candidate.
  - Counter (worst outcome): recruiter will say "If I'm going to hire you, then we'll know".

### When joining a new company, what would be the best approach to minmax?

_3 Simple Rules:_

**1. Learn from the "wizards" - learn as if you want to be like them**
- try to get close to them
    - example: find out their interests and use that to interact with them (best done with good intentions)

**2. Ask a lot - processes, workflows, etc. to GET general context of the company/project you're working on**
- let them know that you're eager for knowledge, curious enough, and actually competent
    - example: ask to be mentioned/be included in ALL the PRs of the project (or to the "wizards"' PRs)
    - example: email these "wizards" to ask for an advice, etc. (most often than not there are willing to help as long as you're not annoying as fuck)
- don't be annoying while doing this (VERY IMPORTANT)

**3. Be Likeable**
- humor plays a big role in relationships
- become a "campfire" - be chill and competent (this is what "aura" is like)

The goal of these rules is to make yourself competent and good enough to be able to work on the projects that you actually like.
